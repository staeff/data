  "description": "Implementing complex systems with microservices can be a great decision, but if we\u2019re not careful we can end up with a distributed monolith. Let\u2019s see how to avoid that by building lightweight, loosely coupled microservices with the Flask framework and Apache Kafka.\n\nSpeaker: Dave Klein\nAfter 28 years as a developer, architect, project manager (recovered), author, trainer, conference organizer, and homeschooling dad, Dave Klein landed his dream job as a developer advocate at Confluent. Dave is marveling in and eager to help others explore the amazing world of event streaming with Apache Kafka.",
