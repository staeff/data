  "description": "So often, in Python, I\u2019ve run up against the question of what type of data structure to use to express something. Does this need a tuple, a dict, a namedtuple, a dataclass, or something else? How do you select what to use, and what are the pros and cons? Let\u2019s explore the options!\n\nSpeaker: Josh Schneider\nJosh is a test automation architect and senior developer. He's trained several junior developers, written millions of lines of code, maintained and supported that code, and pushed for process improvements around development standards, code review, design, and support. He spend a lot of time thinking about how to do things \u201cright\u201d, and how to teach other people. Outside of work, he's a dad of 2 nerdy kids, a trained improv comedian, movie lover, and drinker of beer and coffee.",
