  "description": "As a citizen scientist, you want to learn more, but you\u2019re hitting the limits of your computer. In this live demo, we\u2019ll use Python to build a data lab on a public cloud. We\u2019ll use that infrastructure to explore public data, and we\u2019ll learn a bit more about \u201cthe cloud\u201d along the way.\n\n\nSpeaker: Laura Santamaria\nAs a Developer Advocate at Pulumi, Laura Santamaria loves to learn and explain how things work, bridging the gaps in engineering disciplines. She is a cohost for The Hallway Track podcast, an organizer for DevOpsDays Texas and DevOpsDays Austin, and a co-host for Cloud Austin and Austin DevOps. Previously, Laura worked as a developer advocate at LogDNA and a software developer at Rackspace where, among other things, she owned Deconst, an open-source documentation delivery platform, and MC\u2019ed Rackspace\u2019s internal technical conference. Apart from work, she taught Python for Women Who Code Austin for many years and has been a returning program committee member for Open Source Summit.
