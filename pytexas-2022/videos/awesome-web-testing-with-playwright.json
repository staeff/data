  "description": "Everybody gets frustrated when web apps are broken, but testing them thoroughly doesn't need to be a chore. Playwright, a new open-source browser automation tool from Microsoft, makes testing web apps fun! Playwright offers a slew of nifty features like automatic waiting, mobile emulation, and network interception. Plus, with isolated browser contexts, Playwright tests can set up *much* faster than traditional Web UI tests.\n\nSpeaker: Andrew Knight\nAndrew Knight is the Automation Panda and also a Developer Advocate at Applitools. He strives to help others in solving problems in software development, testing, and quality. Over the past decade, he has designed and built robust test automation projects from the ground up that can run thousands of tests continuously. He is the author of the upcoming book \u201cThe Way To Test Software\u201d from Manning Publications, and he is also the lead developer for Boa Constrictor, the .NET Screenplay Pattern.
