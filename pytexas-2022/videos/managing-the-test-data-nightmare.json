  "description": "Good test data can be a nightmare to manage! It can make-or-break testing efforts. Should we preload our databases? Should we use dynamically-generated dummy data? What about collisions? Let\u2019s cover practical strategies for handling data both in our products and in our test cases.\n\nSpeaker: Andrew Knight\nAndrew Knight is the Automation Panda and also a Developer Advocate at Applitools.
