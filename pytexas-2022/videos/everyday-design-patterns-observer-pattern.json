  "description": "The Observer Pattern enables us to design event-driven systems using loosely coupled components. In this talk, we will learn how, when, and why to use this pattern; we will explore how popular PyPI packages use the pattern; and, we will design a decorator-based Observer to process GitHub events.\n\nSpeaker: Aly Sivji\nAly Sivji is a Canadian ex-pat living in Chicago. By day, he works as a Team Lead at Narrative Science building a platform that generates narrative text using client data. By night, he co-organizes the Chicago Python Users Group (ChiPy). Aly is an active participant in the ChiPy Mentorship Program and he loves helping intermediate developers become experts. Outside of Python, Aly enjoys cycling, reading, and rewatching old TV shows.",
