  "description": "Since The Queen\u2019s Gambit hit Netflix, the number of people playing chess online has skyrocketed. Chances are, some of them are Pythonistas! We\u2019ll dive into python-chess: a library for representing the chess board. Along the way, I\u2019ll show how the library also teaches useful programming concepts.\n\n\nSpeaker: William Horton\nWilliam Horton recently returned to chess during the pandemic, after a 15 year hiatus. On certain weekends he can be found in the local chess club trying his best, but getting beaten by elementary schoolers. By day he works as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Included Health. He is responsible for building and maintaining the Python infrastructure used by data scientists to create models from medical claims data.",
