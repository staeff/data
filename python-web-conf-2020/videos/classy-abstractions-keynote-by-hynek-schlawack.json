    "description": "\"Classy Abstractions (Keynote)\" by: Hynek Schlawack\nGood abstractions can help us make software more correct, easier to understand, and easier to debug. Yet they appear to be widely underappreciated in the Python community. Let\u2019s have a look together at what they can do for you, and hopefully you\u2019ll never put a tuple into a dict ever again.\n\nRecorded at the 2020 Python Web Conference (https://2020.pythonwebconf.com)",
