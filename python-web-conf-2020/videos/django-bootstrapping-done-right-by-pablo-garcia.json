    "description": "\"Django Bootstrapping Done Right\" by: Pablo Garcia\n\nWe have been working with Django for many years and we discovered we were always repeating the same things at the beginning of each project. pycodestyle checks, unit tests, automated deployment, we where doing all of them over and over again and occasionally we were missing important things that would make our lives easier.\n\nThat\u2019s why we decided to create and maintain template repository with all the required tools to bootstrap a Django project. It has become very valuable for our company and that\u2019s why we want to share it with the community. The project is now open source and we will review all it in this talk.\n\nVirtual environments.\nPyenv and Pipenv\nUseful dependencies for development (debug toolbar, extensions, django-environ, etc.)\nServices your application depends on\nDocker quickstart\nCompose example with DB (PostgreSQL), Cache (Redis), NGINX and RQ\nGit hooks\nTests\nFlake\nPEP8\nPylint\nJSCPD\nDeployment\nDeployment stack. Typical pieces of a small application.\nDeploying to Heroku\nCI/CD + Feature branch flow\nPipelines\nCheckstyle tools\nSlack integration\n\nRESOURCES: https://2020.pythonwebconf.com/tutorials/django-bootstrapping-done-right\n\nRecorded at the 2020 Python Web Conference (https://2020.pythonwebconf.com)",
