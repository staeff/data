    "description": "\"Nornir: Solve Big Problems Fast\" by: Brett Lykins\nManaging over 60,000 network devices can be a mind-boggling and difficult task.\n\nOver the years at Rackspace, we have tried many tools and frameworks to help us wrangle this problem, with varying degrees of success.\n\nRecently, we\u2019ve begun making use of Nornir to rapidly solve some of our complex and pressing issues.\n\nNornir, as a native Python automation framework, allows us to leverage our existing Python based infrastructure, applications, and libraries and generate meaningful and powerful APIs and services for our end users and administrators.\n\nBy utilizing Nornir\u2019s built in Inventory, Task, and Result handling framework, we can quickly solve a problem and have an application from prototype to production in under a week.\n\nThis allows our network developers to focus on solving the problem at hand, not on reinventing the wheel for every new API or application that is needed.\n\nRecorded at the 2020 Python Web Conference (https://2020.pythonwebconf.com)",
