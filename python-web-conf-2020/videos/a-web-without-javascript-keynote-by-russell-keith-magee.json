    "description": "\"A Web without JavaScript (Keynote)\" by: Russell Keith-Magee\n\nIn the browser, you can use any programming language you want... as long as it's JavaScript.\n\nBut what if you want to use a different language? In this talk, you'll learn how you can break out of the monolingual environment provided by the browser, and use Python (or any other language) instead.\n\nRecorded at the 2020 Python Web Conference (https://2020.pythonwebconf.com)",
