    "description": "\"Time to get real with AI\" by: Chris Riley\n\nA lot of time conversations about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and recognition technology like Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) seem like fairy dust. As more and more of this technology is implemented into applications, and Python - one of the leading languages for it. It is important to tie the magic with reality. In this talk, we will explore the basis of these technologies, the real world applications, and how to make sure that implementation is useful to the end-user. Expecting AI/ML to deliver magic to an application can lead to missed expectations, and poor rollout.\n\nRecorded at the 2020 Python Web Conference (https://2020.pythonwebconf.com)",
