    "description": "\"Machine Learning Madness into Web Applications on the Cloud\" by: Suman Debnath\n\nIn this talk we will dive deep into one the ML algorithm(Gradient Boosting based models) using Python, and shall build a web application with the model, using Flask and shall deploy the application on the Cloud. We will walk through the whole process step by step via live code, and deploy the application with ease. The idea is to help and motivate the audience to get some glimpse of the limitless opportunity we can have, by threading machine learning intelligence to any web application to solve some interesting real world problem, and all using few lines of Python code.\n\nRecorded at the 2020 Python Web Conference (https://2020.pythonwebconf.com)",
