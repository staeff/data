    "description": "\"AI Content Prediction for Large Websites\" by: Mike Moran\nLarge websites (tens of thousands of pages, or much. much more) are special beasts. There is no perfect information architecture or navigation that can possibly assist everyone to find what they are looking for. We can learn from Amazon and other highly successful web experiences that two techniques work very well. The first is exceptional site search that delivers on the promise to really find what users are looking for. The second is content recommendation--the ability to automatically suggest the content that the user wants to see next when they are on a certain page. It likely won't surprise you that numerous AI techniques, including Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, are at the heart of the solution, and that large amounts of data about user activity and the content itself are needed to solve this findability problem.\n \nIn this session, you'll learn how Solosegment uses content prediction to help users of large websites find what they are looking for. We'll take you under the hood to show you how content prediction works, as well as show you what APIs we make available for you to embed the data and predictions into your own applications.\n\nRecorded at the 2020 Python Web Conference (https://2020.pythonwebconf.com)",
