    "description": "\"How to Setup a Plone Intranet in Half a Day (Tutorial)\" by: Kim Nguyen\nWhether at work or outside of work, we usually need to collaborate with others.\n\nThis collaboration can take many forms:\n- storing documents\n- organizing documents\n- sharing documents\n- creating and filling out forms\n- protecting documents and data from prying eyes\n- managing access to documents and data\n- finding documents and data\n\nEnterprises enable this kind of collaboration by creating an intranet. Users must log into this intranet, quickly and easily find the documents and data they need, revise them, save them, and share them out to others on their project teams. Intranet administrators create teams and set aside workspaces for those teams.\nSetting up this type of intranet does NOT have to be hard nor does it have to be expensive!\nPlone is a longstanding, secure, open source web content management system that lets you create intranets like this.\n\nRESOURCES: https://2020.pythonwebconf.com/tutorials/how-to-setup-a-plone-intranet-in-half-a-day\n\nRecorded at the 2020 Python Web Conference (https://2020.pythonwebconf.com)",
