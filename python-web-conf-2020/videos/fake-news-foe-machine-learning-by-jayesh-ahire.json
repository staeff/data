    "description": "\"Fake News' Foe: Machine Learning\" by: Jayesh Ahire\n\nFake news has become a huge issue in our digitally-connected world and it is no longer limited to little squabbles \u2013 fake news spreads like wildfire and is impacting millions of people every day.\n\nHow do you deal with such a sensitive issue? Countless articles are being churned out every day on the internet \u2013 how do you tell real from fake? It\u2019s not as easy as turning to a simple fact-checker which is typically built on a story-by-story basis. As developers, can we turn to machine learning?\n\nIn this talk, We will try to live code an application using TensorFlow and twilio WhatsApp API to detect fake news! While going through the code we will explore various machine learning concepts and new features in TensorFlow 2.0 which simplifies our job.\n\nWe will also touch base on how we can use Advanced pre-trained NLP models like BERT, GPT-2, XLNet, Grover etc, to achieve our goal! This will be insightful session for beginners as well as intermediate level audience.\n\nRecorded at the 2020 Python Web Conference (https://2020.pythonwebconf.com)",
