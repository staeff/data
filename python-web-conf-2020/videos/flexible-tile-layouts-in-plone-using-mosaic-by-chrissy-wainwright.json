    "description": "\"Flexible Tile Layouts in Plone using Mosaic\" by: Chrissy Wainwright\n\nMosaic (plone.app.mosaic) provides the ability for Plone site editors to build custom layouts without having to edit templates or build custom views.\n\nAs a developer, you can construct more building blocks (tiles) that will be available to the editors in the site. But the process for creating new tiles isn\u2019t very straightforward.\n\nThis talk will walk through the steps to create a new tile - where the title, body text, and background image will be easily managed by your editors.\n\nRecorded at the 2020 Python Web Conference (https://2020.pythonwebconf.com)",
