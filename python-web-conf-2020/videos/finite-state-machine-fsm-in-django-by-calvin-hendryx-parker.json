    "description": "\"Finite State Machine (FSM) in Django\" by: Calvin Hendryx-Parker\n\nWorkflows are super powerful tools for automating business processes online. Our everyday life is full of workflows such as requesting time off from work. Many of these are actually Finite State Machines that move from state to state via transitions. Popular CMS\u2019 such as Plone have rich support for workflows, but now with django-fsm we can build quick, lightweight business workflows for our applications. Plus, we have full audit logging and even build visualizations of our workflow to confirm with the business owners generated from the code.\n\nRecorded at the 2020 Python Web Conference (https://2020.pythonwebconf.com)",
