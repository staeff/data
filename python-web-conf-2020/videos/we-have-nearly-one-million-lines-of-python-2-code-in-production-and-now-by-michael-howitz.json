    "description": "\"We Have Nearly One Million Lines of Python 2 Code in Production \u2013 and Now?\" by: Michael Howitz\n\nIn this talk I am going to present possible approaches for a Python 3 migration of existing Python code running on Python 2.7. I\u2019ll evaluate which of these approaches seems suitable for a large code base and which principles should be paid attention to to increase the probability of a successful migration project.\n\nI\u2019ll use union.cms (a content management system used by German trade unions) to show the story of a successful migration project involving nearly one million lines of Python code. The story will include the obstacles we encountered and what we learned on the way.\n\nI believe that most of the discussed ideas and experience should also be used unchanged in smaller projects as the presented principles are very much the same.\n\nGoal of the presentation: You should be able to come up with a plan for migrating your Python 2 based projects to Python 3.\n\nRecorded at the 2020 Python Web Conference (https://2020.pythonwebconf.com)",
