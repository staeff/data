    "description": "\"CI/CD for Serverless Applications\" by: Marcia Villalba\nTo get the most out of the agility afforded by serverless, it is essential to build CI/CD pipelines that help teams iterate on code and quickly release features. Serverless and distributed systems in production cannot be done any other way than with a good and efficient CI/CD pipeline.\n\nRecorded at the 2020 Python Web Conference (https://2020.pythonwebconf.com)",
