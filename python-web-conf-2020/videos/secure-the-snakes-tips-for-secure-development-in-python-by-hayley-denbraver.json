    "description": "\"Secure the Snakes! Tips for Secure Development in Python\" by: Hayley Denbraver\n\nDevelopers are asked to solve complex problems and balance competing interests--and sometimes security may fall by the wayside. It is easy enough to consider security as \"somebody else's problem\", but that attitude can come back to bite us. This talk will cover secure coding practices (for both general Python development and Django development) that you can incorporate into your work.  Every step towards more secure code is a win!\n\nRecorded at the 2020 Python Web Conference (https://2020.pythonwebconf.com)",
