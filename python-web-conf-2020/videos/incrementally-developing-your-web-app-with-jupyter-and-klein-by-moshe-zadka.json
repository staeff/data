    "description": "\"Incrementally Developing Your Web App With Jupyter and Klein\" by: Moshe Zadka\n\nStill restarting your app when you add or modify an endpoint? In the 1980s, we had real interactive development environment. Not editors which can run a debugger: an environment you modified by developing code. While 2015 maybe the past, come join a trip back....to the future of 1985. See how to develop an application endpoint by endpoint while it is running, leaving auto-restarting directory monitors in the 2015 past where they belong.\n\nRecorded at the 2020 Python Web Conference (https://2020.pythonwebconf.com)",
