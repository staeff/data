    "description": "To comment or not? A data-driven look at attitudes toward code comments\" by: Veronica Hanus\n\nEvery programmer has asked themselves \u201chow many comments are too many?\u201d To the newest programmers, comments may seem magical--a way of documenting without giving instructions to the computer. But commenting engages the same vulnerability as more advanced challenges (i.e. pair programming & code review) and is likely to pique the insecurity of many programmers (especially the copy-and-paste or tutorial-level programmer)!\n\nWhile most of us agree that commenting is part of writing maintainable code, it\u2019s very difficult for someone who has not yet worked in a community-reviewed codebase to know what is good practice and not. The answers that come back often conflict each other: Code should be DRY, but well-placed comments save future devs. How can someone find the commenting style that is best for them as they learn, grow, & contribute? My survey of 170 long-time developers, Computer Science majors, bootcamp grads, & hobby programmers confirms some expectations and brings others into question. Join me for a data-based chat about the biggest pain points caused by our attitudes toward commenting and the steps we can take to encourage a growth mindset and empower programmers of all levels.\n\nRecorded at the 2020 Python Web Conference (https://2020.pythonwebconf.com)",
