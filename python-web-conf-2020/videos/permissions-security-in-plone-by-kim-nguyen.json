    "description": "\"Permissions & Security in Plone\" by: Kim Nguyen\n\nData security makes news headlines, often for the wrong reasons, when it has not been implemented correctly, or when it has been added to systems as an afterthought.\n\nPlone is a secure, open source web content management system that is written in Python and has been under active development since 2001.\n\nOne of Plone's great strengths is its baked-in security model, which is comprised of:\n\nobject- and field-level permissions\nroles\ngroups\nworkflow states, transitions, and guards\nIn this talk, I will explain the elements of Plone's time-tested security model and I will show how these elements work together to help developers create websites and web applications that are secure by default.\n\nRecorded at the 2020 Python Web Conference (https://2020.pythonwebconf.com)",
