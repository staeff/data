    "description": "\"Your First Plone 6 Project\" by: Philip Bauer\nTrying your hand at a new technology can be demanding. If you already know Python and Plone getting started with React and Volto gets much easier.\n\nIn this talk I will pick some tasks from the example project of the Mastering Plone training and show you how to meet the same requirements using Volto, the new React-based front end for Plone.\n\nRecorded at the 2020 Python Web Conference (https://2020.pythonwebconf.com)",
