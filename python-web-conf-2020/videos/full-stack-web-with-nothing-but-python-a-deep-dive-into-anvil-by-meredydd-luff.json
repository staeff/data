    "description": "\"Full-Stack Web with Nothing But Python: A Deep Dive into Anvil\" by: Meredydd Luff\n\nThe Web stack is famously complicated, with a huge number of languages and libraries for even a simple app. What if, instead, we could do it all in Python?\nI'll be taking a deep dive into Anvil, an open-source framework for building full-stack web-apps with nothing but Python. That means Python in the browser, Python on the server, Python for the database - even a Python UI toolkit! I'll be digging into how Anvil works, but *why* it's so important to bring Pythonic values to the full web stack.\n\nRecorded at the 2020 Python Web Conference (https://2020.pythonwebconf.com)",
