    "description": "\"Dead-end Streets\" by: Daniele Procida\n\nSooner or later, every technological direction we take leads to a dead-end. Dead-ends aren\u2019t necessary bad things; it can be very pleasant to live at the end of a cul-de-sac. But, comfortable or not, a dead-end can be hard to get out of, and what\u2019s more, the more comfortable it is, the longer we\u2019re inclined to stay there and the harder it is to extract ourselves. This talk is about a very comfortable dead-end, and why I\u2019ll be sorry to leave it. It\u2019s also about the brand new direction, how we get ourselves ready for the exit.\n\nRecorded at the 2020 Python Web Conference (https://2020.pythonwebconf.com)",
