    "description": "\"Python - Web - Observability (Keynote)\" by: Steve Flanders\n\nWe now live in a Cloud Native world where we build and deploy software very differently from the previous generation. As companies began to build or migrate to microservice architectures they often run into operational complexity and struggle to efficiently monitor their environments. These challenges have highlighted the need to observe systems differently and lead to the rise of Observability.\n\nRecorded at the 2020 Python Web Conference (https://2020.pythonwebconf.com)",
