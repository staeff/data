  "description": "This talk was presented at PyBay2020 Online Edition. It\u2019s the 5th annual Bay Area Regional Python conference. See pybay.com for more details about PyBay and click SHOW MORE for information about this talk.\n\nDESCRIPTION\nThere are three reactions to the title of this talk:\n\n- What the heck\u2019s a probabilistic data structure?\n- UFO Sightings\u2026 wha?\n- 112,092 is an oddly specific number.\n\nThis is a talk about the first bullet point with the second thrown in just for fun. I like weird stuff\u2014UFOs, Bigfoot, peanut butter and bologna on toast\u2014maybe you do too? As far as the third bullet point, well, that\u2019s how many sightings I have.\n\nNow, if you\u2019re like most developers, you probably have no idea what probabilistic data structures are. In fact, I did a super-scientific poll on Twitter and found that out of 119 participants, 58% had never heard of them and 22% had heard the term but nothing more. I wonder what percentage of that 22% heard the term for the first time in the poll. We\u2019re a literal-minded lot at times.\n\nAnyhow. That\u2019s 4 out of 5 developers or, as I like to call it, the Trident dentist ratio. (It\u2019s actually a manifestation of the Pareto principle but I\u2019m a 70s kid). That\u2019s a lot of folks that need to be educated. So, let\u2019s do that.\n\nA probabilistic data structure is, well, they\u2019re sort of like the TARDIS\u2014bigger on the inside\u2014and JPEG compression\u2014a bit lossy. And, like both, they are fast, accurate enough, and can take you to interesting places of adventure. That last one might not be something a JPEG does.\n\nMore technically speaking, most probabilistic data structures use hashes to give you faster and smaller data structures in exchange for precision. If you\u2019ve got a mountain of data to process, this is super useful. In this talk, we\u2019ll briefly go over some common probabilistic data structures; dive deep into a couple (Bloom Filter, MinHash, and Top-K); and show a running application that makes use of Top-K to analyze the most commonly used words in all 112,092 of my UFO sightings.\n\nWhen we\u2019re done, you\u2019ll be ready to start using some of these structures in your own applications. And, if you use the UFO data, maybe you\u2019ll discover that the truth really is out there.\n\nSPEAKER BIO\nGuy works for Redis Labs as a Developer Advocate. Combining his decades of experience in writing software with a passion for sharing what he has learned, Guy goes out into developer communities and helps others build great software.\n\nTeaching and community have long been a focus for Guy. He is President of the Columbus JavaScript Users Group, an organizer for the Columbus Machine Learners, and has even has helped teach programming at a prison in central Ohio.\n\nIn his personal life, Guy is a hard-boiled geek interested in role-playing games, science fiction, and technology. He also has a slightly less geeky interest in history and linguistics. In his spare time, he volunteers for his local Cub Scout Pack, goes camping, and studies history and linguistics.\n\nGuy lives in Ohio with his wife, his three teenage sons, and an entire wall of games.\n\nSPONSOR ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThe post production of this and other PyBay2020 videos are made possible by our sponsors:\n- IBM https://community.ibm.com/community/user/datascience/home\n- Rookout https://rookout.com/\n- Anyscale https://anyscale.com\n- Twilio https://twilio.com/\n- JetBrains https://www.jetbrains.com\n- Linode https://linode.com\n- Pearson Informit https://www.informit.com/\n\nEVENT PRODUCER ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThis community conference is produced by organizers of SF Python meetup and volunteers from around the SF Bay Area and beyond.
