  "description": "Django tutorials often use the perspective of a complete newcomer to\nPython and web development, and while they provide a good practical\non-ramp for brand new developers, they are often not quite right for\ndevelopers from other backgrounds.\n\nThe common backbone of MVC development, no matter the base language, is\nthe database and the language specifically for it\u2019s manipulation:\nStructured Query Language (SQL). But Django hides this behind it\u2019s\namazing drawcard, the Object Relational Model (ORM).\n\nBut how can a developer already familiar with SQL get a handle on the\nORM?\n\nThis talk endeavours to introduce the ORM using shared SQL and\nrelational database concepts, showcasing the features the ORM uses to\nmake database querying and manipulation a joy, rather than a burden, to\nthe polyglot developer.\n",
