  "description": "\"Having fun with application design\"\nDo you ever look at your software systems and workflows holistically? Do you ever wonder what could be achieved through smarter designs and dedicated effort? When you design your applications, do you consider developer efficiency and satisfaction as much as end-user experience? Python offers the simplicity and flexibility to achieve both.\n\nIn this talk, I will explore a journey from supporting disjointed components and addressing ad hoc business requests to developing a technical vision and creating an elegant solution that both serves business needs and offers developers a pleasant support experience. I will also highlight the design thinking approach, software architecture \u201c-ilities\u201d concepts, and the decision process that took place during this project.\nSpeaker: Natalya Buga\n\nNatalya is a senior software developer at Bloomberg. She is passionate about designing elegant and intuitive applications that solve her users\u2019 needs, while offering developers a pleasant support experience.
