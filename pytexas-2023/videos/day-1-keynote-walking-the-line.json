  "description": "\"Walking The Line\"\nBrandon draws on more than 20 years of experience with Python and 30 years with Unix to offer effective patterns and practices to the audiences of his talks, writing, and training. His Python Patterns website offers Pythonic alternatives to the design patterns that are necessary in less flexible languages. He\u2019s the author of both the old PyEphem astronomy library as well its modern alternative Skyfield, along with smaller projects like the elegant little logging_tree module that\u2019s compatible with every Python back to Python 2.3. He is a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, on whose behalf he served as the volunteer chair of PyCon 2016\u20132017 in Portland.",
