  "description": "\"A Tale of Two Typings\"\nWe discuss two different methodologies we have used to add type annotations to our Python services: gradually adding type annotations, or incrementally re-writing the code with type annotations. We'll discuss the benefits and challenges of each, when either may be appropriate, and our real-world experiences doing both.\nSpeaker: Thomas Stephens",
