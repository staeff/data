  "description": "\"How to Build and Ship More Secure Python Apps with Sigstore\"\nSoftware supply chain security is increasingly important to the open-source ecosystem, but the learning curve can be steep. Certificate authorities, transparency logs, keys, signing\u2026 and even keyless signing! What do these terms all mean and how can a Python developer incorporate tools that make their projects more secure?\n\nThis talk will provide a high-level overview of the developer-first open-source project, Sigstore, within the Python context. We\u2019ll go through each component of Sigstore, including how to sign a software artifact with Cosign, how Fulcio issues certificates, and finally how developers and end users alike can verify claims made on the Rekor public ledger. We\u2019ll discuss how PyPI is leveraging Sigstore to help with verifying and trusting dependencies we all rely on. Finally, we\u2019ll go through a demonstration of creating, publishing and signing a containerized Python app.\n\nThe audience will walk away with an understanding of how they can navigate software security more effectively and be better citizens of open source by implementing recommended security practices.\nSpeaker: Lisa Tagliaferri\n\n\nLisa Tagliaferri builds teams, technical resources, and open-source software in the tech startup space.
