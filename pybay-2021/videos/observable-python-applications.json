See pybay.com for more details about PyBay and click SHOW MORE for information about this talk.\n\nDESCRIPTION\nWhat is your Python application doing in production? How do you know?\n\nLogs, events, and metrics are all concepts that are bandied about for the elusive goal of \"observability\". When should you use structlog? Is OpenTelemetry worth it? How do you integrate with Prometheus? What sort of data goes where?\n\nSPEAKER BIO\nMoshe has been using open source software since 1995, and has been using Python as his main development language since 1998.
