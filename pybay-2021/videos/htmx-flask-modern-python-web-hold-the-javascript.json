  "description": "This talk was presented at PyBay2021 Food Truck Edition - 6th annual Bay Area Regional Python conference. See pybay.com for more details about PyBay and click SHOW MORE for information about this talk.\n\nDESCRIPTION\nThere has been a strong drumbeat to move away from server-side programming and lean more and more heavily on JavaScript, especially for dynamic and interactive web sites. With the recent release of HTMX, there is another path Python developers can choose. Use declarative programming on the client side with nearly pure HTML and CSS and double down on back-end Python (Flask, Django, FastAPI, and other frameworks).\n\nIn this session, Michael Kennedy will present some of the cleanest Flask code you have seen while at the same time adding rich interactivity on the front-end -- all the while with no JavaScript in side. It's a new, and likely better, way to think about building dynamic Python web apps.\n\nSPEAKER BIO\nA Python and MongoDB enthusiast, and an entrepreneur. Host of @TalkPython and @PythonBytes, founder of Talk Python Training. Python Software Foundation Fellow.\n\nSPONSOR ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThe post production of this and other PyBay2020 videos are made possible by our sponsors:\n- Carta https://carta.com\n- Anyscale https://anyscale.com\n- Goodrx https://goodrx.com\n- Nginx https://nginx.com\n- Bit.io https://bit.io\n\nEVENT PRODUCER ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThis community conference is produced by organizers of SF Python meetup and volunteers from around the SF Bay Area and beyond.
