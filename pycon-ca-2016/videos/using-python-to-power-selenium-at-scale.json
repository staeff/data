At Dropbox, I and my co-workers\nuse Python to deliver test results to hundreds of other engineers. Come\nlearn the lessons we have learned so far!\n\nBrandon Rhodes Bio\n------------------\n\nBrandon Rhodes works at Dropbox where he strives to deliver a\nworld-class Python development environment to his fellow Dropboxers.
