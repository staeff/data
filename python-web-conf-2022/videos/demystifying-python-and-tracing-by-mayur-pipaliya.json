    "title": "Demystifying Python and Tracing",
    "description": "With so much change in applications, teams that build them, and the underpinnings of those apps and services, complexity is at its peak. Traditional tracing provides limitations when it is used to troubleshoot applications built on a distributed software architecture. With microservices scaling independently, it is often common for there to be many versions of a single instance running across a disparate infrastructure. Oh, the complexity continues! During our time together, we will unravel and demystify this complexity together as it relates to Python and Tracing so you walk away more equipped to dominate in your role.\n\n#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.\n\nMore information about the conference can be found at: https://2022.pythonwebconf.com",
