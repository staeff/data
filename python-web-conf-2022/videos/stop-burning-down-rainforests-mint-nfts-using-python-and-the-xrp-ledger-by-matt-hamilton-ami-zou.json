    "title": "Stop Burning Down Rainforests: Mint NFTs using Python and the XRP Ledger",
    "description": "Many people have heard about NFTs (Non Fungible Tokens) and their uses in art, licensing, gaming and more. But one of the big criticisms is the environmental impact of some of the original blockchains. In this talk we will be showing how to build a Python web service to mint NFTs on the XRP Ledger, the first carbon neutral blockchain.\n\n#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.\n\nMore information about the conference can be found at: https://2022.pythonwebconf.com",
