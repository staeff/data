    "description": "Healthcare organizations aggregate petabytes of data which help drive life-changing health and business decisions. In this presentation, we\u2019ll show you how Indiana\u2019s largest healthcare institution went from using proprietary tools that were hard to maintain and nearly impossible to scale \u2014 to implementing a new world of cloud native and open source tooling, including Airflow, Spark, Delta Lakes (delta.io) and Terraform. We\u2019ll showcase how making a big change to a data pipeline infrastructure can:\n* simplify and automate workflow processes;\n* enable organizations to import existing and new data sources quickly, efficiently and at scale;\n* keep costs down in relation to the number and volume of data sources; \n* hire and onboard new developers \u2014 who have experience working with the open source tools \u2014 quickly, eliminating the tech learning curve that existed with the proprietary tools.\n\n#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.\n\nMore information about the conference can be found at: https://2022.pythonwebconf.com",
