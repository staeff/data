    "title": "Implementing Strong Data Encryption in Python Applications",
    "description": "Data encryption is essential for the modern business. It\u2019s necessary for preventing data breaches, achieving regulatory compliance, and minimizing risk to customers, shareholders, and the business.\n\nThe problem is that most data encryption solutions are a band-aid that doesn\u2019t meet a business\u2019s actual needs. Encrypting data at some point in its lifecycle provides no benefit if the data is unencrypted when an attacker tries to access it.\n\nThis talk discusses the limitations of common encryption schemes and the threats that they do and don\u2019t protect against. After discussing what doesn\u2019t work, we\u2019ll look at how to implement encryption that actually works in Python\n\n#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.\n\nMore information about the conference can be found at: https://2022.pythonwebconf.com",
