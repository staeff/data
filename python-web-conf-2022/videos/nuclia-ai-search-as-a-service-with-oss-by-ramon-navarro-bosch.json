    "title": "Nuclia: AI Search as a Service with OSS",
    "description": "The talk will be separated into four parts:\n\nMVP: How we were able to deliver value based on Guillotina framework for a fast prototype.\n\nData normalization: How we normalize unstructured data, including videos and audios, and extract value from it using NLP.\n\nNucliaDB: a new open-source, cloud native & multimodal indexing database with high reading performance.\n\nNuclia OSS: Our open source plan and how we want to help OSS projects like Fast API, Django, Guillotina, Plone, Flask, Pyramind... to deliver more value. The talk will cover how Nuclia is changing the search industry status quo: It will show how using Nuclia's end-to-end API, is able to index and process any kind of data, including audios and videos, to boost applications with an AI & multi-language semantic search engine. We will specially focus on NucliaDB, the NLP database designed to store non structured information to provide fine grained searchability.\n\n#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.\n\nMore information about the conference can be found at: https://2022.pythonwebconf.com",
