    "title": "Make the Most of Django",
    "description": "Django is one of the longest running open source web frameworks but despite this it is still one of the best around and continues to be actively developed.\n\nApproaching such software can be intimidating to a novice developer as well as an experienced one because it is the result of over 15 years of excellent developers work and it would take a long time to get to know it thoroughly.\n\nIn this talk we will see together the way I found for anyone to take full advantage of Django while contributing to its success and that of its community.\n\n#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.\n\nMore information about the conference can be found at: https://2022.pythonwebconf.com",
