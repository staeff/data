    "title": "Tutorial: Idiomatic Pandas",
    "description": "Pandas can make it quick and easy to slice and dice your data. But what if you need to come back to your manipulations? How do you track data from end to end? How do you write code that you can share with your colleagues? How do you write code that you will understand later?\n\n#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.\n\nMore information about the conference can be found at: https://2022.pythonwebconf.com",
