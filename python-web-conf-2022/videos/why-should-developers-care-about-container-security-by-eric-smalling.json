    "title": "Why Should Developers Care About Container Security?",
    "description": "Container scanning tools, industry publications, and application security experts are constantly telling us about best practices for how to build our images and run our containers. Often these non-functional requirements seem abstract and are not described well enough for those of us that don\u2019t have an appsec background to fully understand why they are important.\n\nIn this session, we will:\n\n* go over several of the most common practices to best containerize Python applications\n* show examples of how your application can be exploited in a container\n* and most importantly, how to easily spot issues and fix your Dockerfiles and deployment manifests before you commit your code\n\n#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.\n\nMore information about the conference can be found at: https://2022.pythonwebconf.com",
