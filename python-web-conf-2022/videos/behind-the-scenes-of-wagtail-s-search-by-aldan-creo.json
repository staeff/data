In this talk, I\u2019ll guide you over how to do a standard setup of a search backend in the Wagtail CMS on an example test website. We\u2019ll start from scratch, and build from there.\n\n\nThroughout the talk, we\u2019ll also explore the way search is internally implemented, to better understand its capabilities and limitations.\n\n\nCome jump right into the world of searches, and \u201cfind\u201d your way to index your contents and make them available to your users\n\n\n#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet.
