    "title": "Predict Lightning Strikes using Django and AWS",
    "description": "What if you could predict the first strike of any thunderstorm with a 99.6% accuracy and a 15- to 25-minute lead time (saving time, money and lives)? With FLASH Scientific Technology, the only lightning predictive service on the market, you can.\n\nIn this case study and product demo, we\u2019ll discuss how to take an algorithm and idea from a Jupyter Notebook to production ready and cloud native. You\u2019ll learn best practices for:\n* optimizing Python code structure;\n* building APIs with Django that are fast, efficient and accurate; and\n* deploying serverless and scalable applications using AWS Lambda and AWS Fargate.\n\n#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.\n\nMore information about the conference can be found at: https://2022.pythonwebconf.com",
