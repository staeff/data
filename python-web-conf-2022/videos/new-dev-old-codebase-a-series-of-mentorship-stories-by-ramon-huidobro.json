    "title": "New dev, old codebase: A series of mentorship stories",
    "description": "My aim with this talk is to inspire folks to try a hand at mentorship.\n\nI\u2019ll cover the example of peers having attended a Rails Girls workshop and then a few months later being a mentor at one. Mentorship is relative, and loads of initiatives are structured this way! That being said, I believe the intended audience can be relative newcomers to programming.\n\nAn outline is as follows:\n* Clarifications: Mentorship vs training vs teaching\n* Volunteering mentorship (Personal examples: Teaching children, Rails Girls Summer of Code, workshops)\n* Mentorship best practices\n* At the workplace (Onboarding a junior developer to a recent codebase)\n* Conclusions, further reading\n\nTakeaways/topics covered include:\n* Responsibility in leaving an impression on a newer programmer\n* Encouraging good habits\n* Being supportive\n* Learning alongside mentees\n* Admitting when you don\u2019t know the answer or the solution to something\n* Letting mentees voice their ideas\n* Starting out as a mentor (finding places to mentor)\n* Communities of practise\n* Showing mentees your problem-solving process\n* Sharing the joy of sharing knowledge\n\n#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.\n\nMore information about the conference can be found at: https://2022.pythonwebconf.com",
