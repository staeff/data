    "title": "In-Place Migrations with Plone, Feels Like Magic",
    "description": "Plone migrations are challenging by nature. There's no one size meets all approach. Add-ons and custom content can make the task feel impossible at times. However, once all the details are hammered out \u2014 and when it's all send and done \u2014 the final process can feel like magic.\n\n\nSix Feet Up was tasked with migrating a Plone site from 5.1 to 5.2 on Python 3. In this case study, we discuss:\n* choosing a migration method\n\n* preparing the site and data, and\n* refining the migration steps to ensure a smooth In-Place migration.\n\n\n#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.\n\n\n\nMore information about the conference can be found at: https://2022.pythonwebconf.com",
