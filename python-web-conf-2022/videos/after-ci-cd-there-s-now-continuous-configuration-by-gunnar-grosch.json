    "title": "After CI/CD, there's now Continuous Configuration",
    "description": "In the last decade, the movement towards CI/CD has been transformational for getting value out to customers quickly. But in recent years, there has been new processes and tooling towards using configuration post-deployment, in the form of feature flags, operational config, or other runtime configuration. Continually adjusting the configuration to update and tune your code in production is a powerful, fast, and safe way to deploy value to customers. Join us in a discussion about how Amazon uses Continuous Configuration tools at scale to move fast and ensure maximum availability of our services.\n\nNote: Includes Python-based demo of how continuous configuration can be used.\n\n#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.\n\nMore information about the conference can be found at: https://2022.pythonwebconf.com",
