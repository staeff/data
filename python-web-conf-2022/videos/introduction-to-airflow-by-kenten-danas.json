    "description": "Anyone with Python knowledge can deploy a workflow using Apache Airflow \u2014 a platform created by the community to programmatically author, schedule and monitor workflows. The platform does not limit the scope of your pipelines; you can use it to build ML models, transfer data, manage your infrastructure and more. During this presentation, Kenten will share use cases and typical integration points/workflows.\n\n#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.\n\nMore information about the conference can be found at: https://2022.pythonwebconf.com",
