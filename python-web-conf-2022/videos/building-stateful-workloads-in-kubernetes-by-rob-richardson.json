    "title": "Building Stateful Workloads in Kubernetes",
    "description": "It\u2019s day 2. Kubernetes is running. You have your deployments and services set. Now how do you migrate the data store? Let\u2019s journey together on this code-focused tour through Persistent Volumes, Persistent Volume Claims, and StatefulSets. We\u2019ll craft and launch a strategy to care for your users\u2019 data in this new container world. You can power your business on Kubernetes: stateless or stateful.\n\nIt\u2019s (relatively) easy to build stateless web properties in containers, but it\u2019s a much different beast to build data stores in Kubernetes. We\u2019ll disambiguate PV, PVC, and Stateful Sets in simple ways so you can get past this next hurdle of K8s knowledge.\n\n#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.\n\nMore information about the conference can be found at: https://2022.pythonwebconf.com",
