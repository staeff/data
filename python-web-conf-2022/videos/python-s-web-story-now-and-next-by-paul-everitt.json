    "title": "Python's Web Story: Now and Next",
    "description": "In 2019 we lamented Python\u2019s web story. The web hasn\u2019t stood still and neither has Python. In this keynote we reframe the issue in updated terms. We then explain how the JavaScript world has innovated like crazy, and hear from important voices in Python about the near future of Python and the web.\n\n\n#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.\n\n\n\nMore information about the conference can be found at: https://2022.pythonwebconf.com",
