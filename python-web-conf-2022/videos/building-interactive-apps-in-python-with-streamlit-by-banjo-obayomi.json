    "title": "Building Interactive Apps in Python with Streamlit",
    "description": "Developing full stack web applications can be an exhaustive process, with having to manage both frontend and backend development. For python developers frameworks like Django take time to learn and come with many bells and whistles that may not be needed for simple applications. Streamlit is a framework that blends raw python code with a simple API that turns scripts into shareable web apps in minutes., without needed any front end experience. This talk will walk through creating a Streamlit app and showing off how flexible the framework is for building solutions.\n\n#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.\n\nMore information about the conference can be found at: https://2022.pythonwebconf.com",
