    "title": "Welcome to Plone 6",
    "description": "The Plone content management system is one of the earliest and most successful open-source stories of the Python community. In this talk, we present its latest version, Plone 6, and how you can build your next solution, whether using its classic SSR front end or its now React front end, or using its REST API as a headless content store for your Django and Flask apps.\n\n#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.\n\nMore information about the conference can be found at: https://2022.pythonwebconf.com",
