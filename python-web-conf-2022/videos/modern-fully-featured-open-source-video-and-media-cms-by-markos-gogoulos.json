    "description": "With MediaCMS, a modern and open-source CMS built in Django/React, you can create your own YouTube style video portal in just a few minutes \u2014 and self-host your content! In this presentation and live demo, I\u2019ll:\n\n* showcase MediaCMS\u2019 functionality through a demo installation,\n* discuss uses cases,\n* share a road map of future development, and\n* review the CMS\u2019 architecture.\n\nThe presentation will also feature best practices for organizing an open-source project to facilitate cooperation and contributions. We\u2019ll also explore different options towards sustainability of an open-source project.\n\n#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet.
