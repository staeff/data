    "title": "What Do We Pay Our People?",
    "description": "One of the biggest challenges for tech leaders is the subject of compensation. What are market rates? What's the right structure? Cash, equity, options, benefits? It can be a minefield. In this talk we'll discuss some useful general principles and rules of thumb when thinking about comp, and go through some worked examples to focus the discussion. By the end you'll have a clear picture of the comp landscape, how to think about it, and you'll have some tools to help you make good decisions.\n\n#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet.
