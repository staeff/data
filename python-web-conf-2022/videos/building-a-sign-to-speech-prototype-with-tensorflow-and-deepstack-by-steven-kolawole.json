    "title": "Building a Sign-to-Speech prototype with TensorFlow and DeepStack",
    "description": "I built an end-to-end working prototype that uses Computer Vision to detect sign language meanings in images/live videos and generate equivalent, realistic voice of words communicated by the sign language, while also using Machine Translation to map the returned texts to local African languages (in progress), all in real-time. It was fun. And it was stressful too.\n\nIn this talk, I\u2019d talk about the highs and lows of working on this project while also elaborating on the groundwork, the process, the results, and the future scope of the project.\n\nPrevious knowledge expected Machine Learning, Deep Learning\n\n#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.\n\nMore information about the conference can be found at: https://2022.pythonwebconf.com",
