    "description": "Modernization approaches often lack the agility needed to ensure success and maximize value to users. Thinking in terms of events enables adoption of modern technologies (like Serverless) through a Series of Minimum Viable Migrations.\n\n#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.\n\nMore information about the conference can be found at: https://2022.pythonwebconf.com",
