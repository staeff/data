    "title": "Towards Reliability",
    "description": "Applications are evolving continuously. In modern cloud-native microservice architecture-based applications, finding out if your application is reliable or not is hard. Being able to Observe your system doesn't really mean it's reliable. In this talk, we will learn about how to make your software more reliable, touch base on the concept of SLOs, and see a demo of how we can easily collect telemetry data and ensure the reliability of a Python-based microservice application.\n\n#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.\n\nMore information about the conference can be found at: https://2022.pythonwebconf.com",
