    "title": "Python Coding Mistakes, Causes of Vulnerabilities and How to Solve It!",
    "description": "In this session, we will have a look at common mistakes in Python that can cause serious code vulnerabilities. We will subsequently have a look at what those vulnerabilities can cause and how you can get \u201chacked\u201d. We will also discuss how developer and security teams struggle to talk in a common language to prevent and mitigate those vulnerabilities. Lastly, we will see how you can prevent and mitigate them in real-life.\n\n\n#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet.
