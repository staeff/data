    "title": "Using Reproducible Experiments to Create Better Machine Learning Models",
    "description": "When you start exploring multiple model architectures with different hyperparameter values, you need a way to quickly iterate. There are a lot of ways to handle this, but all of them require time and you might not be able to go back to a particular point to resume or restart training.\n\n\nIn this talk, you will learn how you can use the open-source tool, DVC, to compare training metrics using two methods for tuning hyperparameters: grid search and random search. You\u2019ll learn how you can save and track the changes in your data, code, and metrics without adding a lot of commits to your Git history. This approach will scale with your data and projects and make sure that your team can reproduce results easily.\n\n\n#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.\n\n\n\nMore information about the conference can be found at: https://2022.pythonwebconf.com",
