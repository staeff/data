    "title": "Federated Learning in Computer Vision",
    "description": "While researchers have been advancing computer vision algorithms month by month, developers face the problem of training and deploying those same algorithms in the real world. Often, the reason behind low accuracies is accounted for by the low quantity and quality of data available for the problem. Over the past few months, federated learning has been the talk of the town because of its promising future in computer vision. What is federated learning? How to use it? Is it possible to deploy federated learning solutions in the real world? The main focus of this talk will be to demonstrate why, where, and how to use federated learning in computer vision.\n\n#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.\n\nMore information about the conference can be found at: https://2022.pythonwebconf.com",
