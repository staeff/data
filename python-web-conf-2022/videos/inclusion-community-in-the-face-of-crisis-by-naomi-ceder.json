    "title": "Inclusion & Community in the Face of Crisis",
    "description": "Python communities around the world are confronting uncertainty and unanswered questions as a series of crises have unfolded over the past two years. In this talk I would like to reflect on how we can preserve a sense of community in the face of crisis. As we emerge into a post-Covid-19 world, and as we deal with the human and economic consequences of a new war, what challenges might we all face in the future? How can we build and foster community and still keep everyone safe? What are our sources of optimism and hope?\n\n#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.\n\nMore information about the conference can be found at: https://2022.pythonwebconf.com",
