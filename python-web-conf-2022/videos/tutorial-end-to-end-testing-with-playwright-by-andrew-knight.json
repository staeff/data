    "title": "Tutorial: End-to-End Testing with Playwright",
    "description": "Everybody gets frustrated when web apps are broken, but testing them thoroughly doesn't need to be a chore. Playwright, a new open-source browser automation tool from Microsoft, makes testing web apps fun! Playwright outperforms other tools like Selenium WebDriver with a slew of nifty features like automatic waiting, mobile emulation, and network interception. Plus, with isolated browser contexts, Playwright tests can set up * much* faster than traditional Web UI tests.\n\n\nIn this tutorial, we will build a Python test automation project from the ground up. We will automate web search engine tests together step-by-step using Playwright for interactions and pytest for execution. We'll also explore Playwright tricks like cross-browser testing, capturing videos, and even running tests in parallel! By the end of this tutorial, you'll be empowered to test modern web apps with modern web test tools. You'll also have an example project to be the foundation for your future tests.\n\n\n#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.\n\n\nMore information about the conference can be found at: https://2022.pythonwebconf.com",
