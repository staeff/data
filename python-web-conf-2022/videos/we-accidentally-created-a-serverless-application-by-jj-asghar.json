    "title": "We Accidentally Created a Serverless Application",
    "description": "In this talk, we will describe our situation, and how we ended up with a serverless application by accident. We talk about where we started, our use case, and how it turns out leveraging FaaS, Python and the Code-Engine Serverless platform we created a system that is surprisingly robust and super cheap to run.\n\n#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.\n\nMore information about the conference can be found at: https://2022.pythonwebconf.com",
