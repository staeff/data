    "title": "HTMX + Flask: Modern Python Web Apps, Hold the JavaScript",
    "description": "There has been a strong drumbeat to move away from server-side programming and lean more and more heavily on JavaScript, especially for dynamic and interactive web sites. With the recent release of HTMX, there is another path Python developers can choose. Use declarative programming on the client side with nearly pure HTML and CSS and double down on back-end Python (Flask, Django, FastAPI, and other frameworks).\n\nIn this session, Michael Kennedy will present some of the cleanest Flask code you have seen while at the same time adding rich interactivity on the front-end \u2013 all the while with no JavaScript in side. It\u2019s a new, and likely better, way to think about building dynamic Python web apps.\n\n#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.\n\nMore information about the conference can be found at: https://2022.pythonwebconf.com",
