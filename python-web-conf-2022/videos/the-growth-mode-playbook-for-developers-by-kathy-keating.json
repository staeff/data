    "title": "The Growth Mode Playbook for Developers",
    "description": "If we want to survive and thrive in our roles as developers, there are skills beyond coding that will make us most effective in our roles. These skills are the ones that will help us get promoted, and be seen as highly valuable within our organizations. They are especially valuable to learn as the companies around use grow - really fast. In this talk, I\u2019ll share my top 10 skills that I practice every day, and encourage my teams of developers to embrace, so that we can all thrive as we, and our companies grow.\n\n#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet.
