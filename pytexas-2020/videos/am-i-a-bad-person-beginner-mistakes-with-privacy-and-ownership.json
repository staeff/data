  "description": "Am I a bad person? Beginner mistakes with privacy and ownership\nGDPR shook things up for tech in 2018. CCPA is doing the same. It\u2019s our responsibility to respect our users\u2019 data. But as beginners, sometimes we don\u2019t know better. We\u2019ll walk through morally grey mistakes I\u2019ve made when creating client-facing Flask apps and how to fix them up like a good netizen.\n\n\nSpeaker: Abby Carey\nAbby is a Developer Advocate at Google Cloud. She's currently working on tooling and creating a better Python developer experience. Coming from a Technical Writing background, she has always had a passion for helping developers find solutions to their problems. In her down time, she tinkers with VR web development, studies Python fundamentals, and can't put down a good fan fiction.",
