  "description": "Let\u2019s face it, Cloud isn\u2019t as cheap as we thought, especially for non USA based companies. We can however take advantage of free tier usage from various providers. My talk will detail how this can be done. How to deploy, monitor and maintain serverless apps in various cloud providers and save.\n\n\nSpeaker: Erance Sendelani Magoro\nCustomer-Centric, Passionate about Technology and Innovative. I have been involved in several exciting projects from the Architectural phase through to Production over the past 14 years. I have diverse experience across several industries including banking, health-care, finance, insurance and consulting houses. My \"Can do\" attitude coupled with good work ethic has earned me much respect from my peers and continues to do so. I am a self-taught technologist who never stops learning and improving. \"Always aspiring to make today\u2019s altitude a vantage point for tomorrows\" is a personal motto I've always lived by.",
