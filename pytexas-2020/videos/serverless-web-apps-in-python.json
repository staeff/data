  "description": "Serverless technologies have a lot of people excited - in theory, they offer infinite scaling with no maintenance. After mostly seeing \u201chello-world on Lambda\u201d tutorials, I was curious how it would work for a real application with a frontend and a database. This talk reviews my experience using AWS Lambda for full-stack web applications. If you\u2019re familiar with the theory and want to know more about how it works in practice, you\u2019re in the right place.\n\n\nSpeaker: Sanjay Siddhanti\nSanjay is an Engineering Manager at Alpha Health. He loves building software that helps patients have a better experience with healthcare. His interests include data engineering, web development, bioinformatics, and dev ops. Sanjay has a B.S. in Computer Science and M.S. in Biomedical Informatics from Stanford University. Outside of software, he enjoys sports, cooking, and meditation.",
