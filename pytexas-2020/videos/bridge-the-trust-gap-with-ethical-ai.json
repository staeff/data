  "description": "As you prioritize Ethical AI, it can be daunting to determine the correct path forward. This session will arm you with simple tools and technologies to build trust in your models and start implementing ethical AI within your organization today.\n\n\nSpeaker: Gabriella Lio\nI am 25 years young and hail from the great state of Texas. After completing my Masters of Science in Business Analytics degree from UT Austin (Hook em' Horns forever), I joined the brilliant, creative, human, and fun Data Science team at Sense Corp, a tech consulting firm headquartered in Austin. When I'm not building models in Python and hanging out with my co-workers, you can find me exploring all the trails Austin has to offer, lounging on the lake, or catching my favorite band, the Spazmatics every Wednesday!",
