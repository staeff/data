  "description": "What is __init__.py doing? Why is it in all of my directories? If you\u2019re just starting out learning Python (or even if you\u2019ve been using it for decades), these might be questions you\u2019ve asked before. This talk is all about __init__.py: its history, its usage, and what can go wrong with it.\n\n\nSpeaker: William Horton\nWilliam Horton is a Senior Software Engineer at Compass, where he works on systems for ingesting, processing, and serving millions of real estate listings. In his spare time, he blogs and speaks about deep learning, contributes to open-source Python libraries like fastai and pytorch, and competes in computer vision competitions on Kaggle. When he\u2019s not doing tech things, he enjoys powerlifting and singing a cappella.",
